# AdClarity AI

> ✨ Understand why you’re seeing online ads — powered by LLMs.

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

**AdClarity AI** is a lightweight Chrome extension that explains why a user is seeing a specific ad on platforms like LinkedIn. By analyzing ad copy and context, it uses large language models (LLMs) to infer likely targeting logic and advertiser intent — giving users transparent insights into their online ad experience.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User selects an ad** on LinkedIn and clicks the extension icon.
2. The ad text is passed to the extension’s background script.
3. **OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-Turbo** model generates an explanation based on:
   - Possible user interests or behaviors
   - Advertiser's goals (e.g., conversions, awareness)
4. A friendly, structured explanation is shown in the popup.

## 🔐 Security Note

This project uses the OpenAI API key to fetch ad explanations. **Your API key should never be hardcoded or exposed publicly.**  
We've moved the key to a `secrets.js` file that is **excluded via `.gitignore`** to prevent accidental commits.

> **Important**: You are responsible for managing API usage and costs securely. For production use, implement secure proxying and authentication layers.
